/*Notice the private inner static class that contains the instance of the singleton class. When the singleton class is loaded,
 *  InnerSingleton class is not loaded into memory and only when someone calls the getInstance method, 
 *  this class gets loaded and creates the Singleton class instance.

This is the most widely used approach for Singleton class as it doesnâ€™t require synchronization.*/
